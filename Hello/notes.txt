code with harry tutorial django

installing django after installing python - check if all workng fine first like python v and pip

install django

pip install django
pip install django --upgrade 

pip install django==3.0.4  (installing older version -- of ourse latest is 4 and above but the harry has 3 so..)



to make a project
    django-admin startproject Hello    #this is the name of the project
to start the server
    python manage.py runserver

to check all commands
    python manage.py
from those commands you can see startapp
    python manage.py startapp home     # here home is the name of the app

    #so here hello folder is the project and home is the App 
        #there is settings files in the Hello or project folder -- that will help to show where your templates be stored
                                                                    That will also tell what database you will be using. By default its sqlite3
                                                                    Server Tima and all

There is no urls.py in App which is home folder that we have created
    So make urls.py



# Static file concept and Template concept in django

    Static file (Created folder)
        these are files that anyone can see on your server by checking or coming to urls    
            YOU CAN CHECK THAT STATIC URLS THINGS in Settings.py
        all tge static file will be here.. like txt or images etc.
    Templates   (Created folder)
